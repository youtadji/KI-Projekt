# Breakthrough Board Game AI

## Description
This project implements an AI for the Breakthrough board game using a combination of alpha-beta pruning and evolutionary algorithms. The AI is capable of playing the game and making strategic decisions based on the current board state.

## Features
- Bitboard representation of the game state for efficient operations
- Alpha-beta pruning algorithm for move evaluation
- Evolutionary algorithm for move selection
- Dynamic time allocation based on game stage
- FEN (Forsythâ€“Edwards Notation) parsing and manipulation

## ENV
- Python 3.8.10
- Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
- No external libraries required
